'''I need to simulate a data diode using nix os and no external hardware. The architecture i proposed is a source that receives data from the desired location sending to a proxy from sender's side to a proxy in the receiver's side, sending to the sink which forwards the data to the desired destination. The unidirectional diode should work from sender to receiver only not the reverse. A test to should be made to ensure this fails. There can be a database in the receiver side to store the data. 

the requirements identified are 2 nix vm's or containers, with different network namespaces, avoiding direct network reachability between them, use iptables/nftables to ensure unidirectional flow and block all firewall. tests written to check the modules working. use relevant libraries, limit protocols and ports. disable ip forwarding, dhcp. TX and RX side should stay in tact air tight. The flow should be from sender to receiver only with no gap for security lapse. there can be virtual network bridge in the middle too if deemed necessary.

now i have a windows machine and a vbox setup. give me instrustions from scratch on how and from where to get nixos to setting up containers, configuring network, rules, proxy programs, running them simultaneously, ingress and egress container. '''
